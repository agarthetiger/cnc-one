G1 H1 Y-1025 F1500            ; move quickly to Y axis endstop and stop there (first pass)
G1 Y5 F6000                   ; go back a few mm

; Instead of just doing this...
;G1 H1 Y-10 F360               ; move slowly to Y axis endstop once more (second pass)
; ... do this.
; Remember, config.g has this
;   Drives
;     M584 X3 Y2:1 Z0                  ; set drive mapping, 2 is Y-l, 1 is Y-r
;   Endstops
;     M574 Y1 S1 P"!ystop+!e0stop"     ; configure active-low endstops for low end on Y via ystop for physical drive 2 Left and pin e0stop for physical drive 1 Right
